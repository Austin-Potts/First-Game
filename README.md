# First-Game

To use: 
Pip install pygame in the command line.
Running the program using python game.py will start the game!
-------------------------------------------------------------
All the player has to do is use the left and right arrow keys to avoid the blue blocks.
The more blue blocks dodged, the higher the score. 
The progression of the game occurs as the score increases, more blocks will spawn, and they will fall at a faster rate. 

Updates I want to include:
Constant movement with the holding of keys instead of piece by piece movement. 
A final Score recap scene
A Intro screen that will introduce the controls and concepts to the player. 
The ability to toggle screen size, and difficulty within the game window. 
Improved gameplay mechanics such as a firing weapon to remove incoming blocks, power ups, etc.
